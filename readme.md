PROJECT 2 - RED ACADEMY - DONE BY EIRIAN LYNN TA - ABOUT 6 HOURS
Ver 1.0.0


Things that I've learnt after finishing this project:

- GRID (I have never used grid before, so I decided to give it a go in this project instead of using flex which I find more comfortable using. And I think I learnt more about Grid now.)
- Different ways to style the select button
- AJAX
- More JQUERY/JAVASCRIPT
- SCSS
- GULP

I really wanted to adjust the height of the drop-down select box in order to improve user experience, but then I found out that you can't not do it with just css because it depends on the browser, so I tried to find another way to do it. And I found "bootstrap". I've read a lot a bout "bootstrap" and am planning to redo the project 2 using bootstrap to improve the user experience.
